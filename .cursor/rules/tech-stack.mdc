 # Technology Stack Guidelines

> **Important**: All third-party dependencies must be documented in this file.
> - If a dependency is not listed here, it should be flagged for review
> - If an alternative exists in this file, it should be used instead
> - New third-party dependencies must be added here after approval
> This ensures consistent technology choices across the project and prevents duplicate solutions.
